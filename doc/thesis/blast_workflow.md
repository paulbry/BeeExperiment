This example will be using the [Original BLAST Example](https://github.com/paulbry/BeeExperiment/tree/master/examples/bee-og/blast/slurm)
as a baseline. However, there have been a number of changes to better integrate not only the additons to `BeeFlow` but also
the idea of user inputs (templating) that `BeeExperiment` uses. The updated version is found 
[here](https://github.com/paulbry/BeeExperiment/tree/master/examples/flows/inputGeneration/slurm).

Please insure that you can install BEE in addition to the following in order for the example to function correctly.
- Slurm
- Charliecloud
- OpenMPI (1.10.5)
