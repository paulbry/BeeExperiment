The only way I could get this example to run without an error from blast-output.sh
was if I allocated the nodes with this command
LANG=C salloc -p galton -N5
then ran 
bee_orc_ctl.py

and used on the 2nd screen
ssh <headnode (cn30)> 

The container needs to be fixed. Commenting out the line "SendEnv LANG LC_*" 
may work.
